    "Great Circles are powerful tools used in navigation like ships and planes as well as in geoscience for working with and understnading remote sensing via satellites. Great Circle mathematics make use of spherical geometry, where, rather than lines, shapes on a sphere are formed by the intersection of arcs along the curved surface.\n",
