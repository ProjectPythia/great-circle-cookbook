    "This notebook covered how to generate and plot great circle arcs and paths with just a starting and ending position. This also included how to calculate the bearing of a great circle arc as well interpolating along the great circle and even how to find the antipodal point to any point on the globe. You were able to see how the difference between treating the Earth as a sphere or as an ellipsoid impacts the final precision.\n",
