    "## Overview\n",
    "Great circles are powerful tools and historically were commonly used in the navigation of ships. Today, they are a common tool for pilots to plot paths \"as-the-crow-flies\" as well as in geoscience when  working with remote sensing via satellites that pass over the globe in long arcs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics of great circles make use of spherical geometry, where, rather than lines, long arcs are drawn along the surface of a sphere. While spherical geometry played an important role historically in the fields of astronomy and navigation, its teaching has largely fallen out of favor since the 1950's making finding comphrenshive resources difficult.\n",

    "A great circle path is the full path formed by the intersection of a plane which also passes through the center of the sphere. For example, the equator is an example of a great circle path on the Earth. The equator can be imagined as the path formed by a plane cutting through the center of the planet and intersecting the center. A great circle path is a closed path (-180 to 180 degrees longitude) that forms around the sphere.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spherical geometry (and one of it important branches: spherical trigonometry) provide calculations based on the relationshsips between the sides and angles on a sphere that are commonly used in right-angled triangles. Spheres are unique since unlike flat surfaces, spherical triangles can have internal angles that add up to more than 180 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you fly a plane from the Philippines directly North until you reach the top of the Earth (at the North Pole). Then, you turn the plane 50 degrees, and fly down again until you arrive at the starting latitude of Philippines, off the coast of India. Once you have returned to your same starting latitude, you turn 90 degrees and return to the Philippines. By this point, you will have made two 90 degree turns (off the coast of India and the Philippines). So, all the internal angles combined to make this triangle along the Earth are 230 degrees (90 + 90 + 50).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is not equal to 180Â°. A sphere is a curved surface, but locally the laws of the flat (planar) Euclidean geometry are good approximations. In a small triangle on the face of the earth, the sum of the angles is only slightly more than 180 degrees\n",

    "\n",
    "The earth is not round, instead it is an irregular ellipsoid known as a an oblate spheroid where the poles are slightly flatter and the equator bulges out. Spherical trigonometry typically assumes that calculations are occurring on a perfect sphere. For much of history this approximiation was accurate enough to allow ships to find their way to ports, but with increasingly technologically advanced and precise tools (like satellites) this discrepancy becomes more and more pronounced. Any calculation on Earth that assumes the planet is a perfect sphere, and without additional corrections, will contain an error up to 0.3% (22 km) ([see more](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/25494/how-accurate-is-approximating-earth-as-sphere)).\n",
